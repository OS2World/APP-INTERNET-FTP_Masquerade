FTP Masquerade Version 1.10
(C) 2000-2001 Nicholas Paul Sheppard. See the file licence.txt for details.

FTP Masquerade is a small utility for getting around the limitations on FTP
imposed by IP masquerading. It allows a host behind a masquerading firewall use
FTP in active mode (the default mode for most FTP programmes) by tricking the
FTP programme into using the masquerading firewall as a proxy for accessing an
FTP server, in a similar way to IP masquerading.

See the file doc/ftpmasq.txt for instructions on compiling, installing and
using the FTP Masquerade daemon.
